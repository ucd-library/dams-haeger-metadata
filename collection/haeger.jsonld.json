  "schema:description": "This collection contains 16 previously unpublished profiles of mature pinot noir vineyards in California and Oregon researched and written by John Haeger between 2022 and 2024. Most profiles describe a single vineyard, although some cover several. Each profile examines a list of vineyard attributes: location, latitude, proximities, elevation, orientation, aspect, slope and exposures. Profiles may also address prevailing winds and other determinants of micro- and mesoclimate; physical and chemical properties of top soils, subsoils, and base rock, especially porosity and moisture retention; significant modifications (if any) made at or after planting to the site’s natural topography; planting history and plant materials, including the specific sources of scion material; vineyard layout and trellising schemes; the vineyard’s homo- or heterogeneity from one side or block to another; farming practices and historical changes thereto; conversions to/from organic/biodynamic protocols, or to/from irrigation; yield, etc. The profile also captures the history of the vineyard: who, why in this place, why Pinot, from what inspiration, with what help and guidance from whom else, etc.  A final section of each profile contains tasting notes on wines made from grapes grown in the vineyard.",
